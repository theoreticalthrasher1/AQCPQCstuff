Just to check that the projector is working correctly, and so that we are on track to getting the correct initial hamiltonian, 
we've run this code to check which element the Hamiltonian is projecting onto. It turns out the only non-zero element of the matrix
is the $(17,17)$th element, which is what we expect. The Hartree fock state is indeed $|00010001\rangle$.
